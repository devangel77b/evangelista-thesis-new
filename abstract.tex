\begin{abstract}
% The text of the abstract goes here.  If you need to use a \section
% command you will need to use \section*, \subsection*, etc. so that
% you don't get any numbering.  You probably won't be using any of
% these commands in the abstract anyway.
Look at aerial righting and directed aerial descent in Chukar partridges.  In parallel, look at aerodynamic implications of different theropod and bird morphologies.  Consider some the effect of body size on damage and the effect of size and shape on turbulent noise pickup from turbulent flows.  Possibly to wrap up, weave all of these together in a phylogenetic framework.
