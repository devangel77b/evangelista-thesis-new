@article{Hedrick:2007,
	Abstract = {Maneuvering flight has long been recognized as an important component
	of the natural behavior of many bird species, but has been the subject
	of little experimental work. Here we examine the kinematics and neuromuscular
	control of turning flight in the rose-breasted cockatoo Eolophus
	roseicapillus (N=6), testing predictions of maneuvering flight and
	control based on aerodynamic theory and prior kinematic and neuromuscular
	studies. Six cockatoos were trained to navigate between two perches
	placed in an L-shaped flight corridor, making a 90 degrees turn midway
	through each flight. Flights were recorded with three synchronized
	high-speed video cameras placed outside the corridor, allowing a
	three-dimensional reconstruction of wing and body kinematics through
	the turn. We simultaneously collected electromyography recordings
	from bilateral implants in the pectoralis, supracoracoideus, biceps
	brachii and extensor metacarpi radialis muscles. The cockatoos maneuvered
	using flapping, banked turns with an average turn radius of 0.92
	m. The mean rate of change in heading during a complete wingbeat
	varied through the turn and was significantly correlated to roll
	angle at mid-downstroke. Changes in roll angle were found to include
	both within-wingbeat and among-wingbeat components that bear no direct
	relationship to one another. Within-wingbeat changes in roll were
	dominated by the inertial effects while among-wingbeat changes in
	roll were likely the result of both inertial and aerodynamic effects.},
